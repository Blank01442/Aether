// 1. Array Manipulations (Foundational for AI)
say "Allocating a 5-element weight tensor..."
array weights from 5

set i to 0
while i < 5 {
    set val to i * 10
    weights[i] to val
    set i to i + 1

// 2. High-Performance Math
say "Calculating square root of 144:"
set x to 144
set root to sqrt(x)
say root
